# Additional Frameworks or Technology Stacks

## Decision: 
Use the following additional frameworks and technology stacks:

**Push Notification Service:** Integrate with Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for handling push notifications.\
Justification: FCM is a widely adopted and robust push notification service that supports both iOS and Android platforms. It provides reliable delivery of push notifications and allows for segmentation and targeting of specific user groups.

**Payment Gateway:** Integrate with Stripe as the primary payment gateway.\
Justification: Stripe is a popular and trusted payment gateway that offers a secure and user-friendly payment experience. It provides support for various payment methods, currencies, and international transactions.

**Analytics Tool:** Integrate with Google Analytics for tracking user behavior and app performance metrics.\
Justification: Google Analytics is a comprehensive analytics tool that provides detailed insights and metrics on user interactions, app usage, and performance. It offers a user-friendly interface and robust reporting capabilities.

**Image Storage and Optimization:** Use Amazon S3 for cloud-based image storage and implement image optimization techniques such as caching, lazy loading, and compression.\
Justification: Amazon S3 is a reliable and scalable cloud storage service that can efficiently handle image storage. Implementing image optimization techniques helps improve app performance and user experience by reducing image loading times and bandwidth consumption.

**Localization Framework:** Use the Internationalization (i18n) capabilities provided by React Native along with localization libraries like react-i18next or i18next.\
Justification: Leveraging React Native's built-in internationalization features allows for easy localization of the app's UI elements and text content. Libraries like react-i18next or i18next provide additional functionalities and support for managing multiple languages and cultural preferences.



## Alternatives Considered:

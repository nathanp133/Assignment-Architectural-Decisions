# UI Framework

## Decision: 
Use a cross-platform UI framework like React Native.

## Justification:

    React Native allows for code reusability across multiple platforms (iOS and Android), reducing development time and effort.
    React Native provides a native-like user experience with access to platform-specific UI components and features.
    The retail company's requirement to expand its customer base internationally can be better addressed with a cross-platform UI framework like React Native, as it allows for easier localization.
    
## Alternatives Considered:

    Native UI Development: Developing separate UIs for iOS and Android using platform-specific languages and frameworks (e.g., Swift for iOS, Kotlin for Android) would provide more control and customization but require more development effort and resources.
    Hybrid UI Framework: Using a hybrid UI framework like Flutter could also provide cross-platform compatibility, but React Native is more widely adopted and has a larger community support.

## Consequences:
Using React Native may introduce some performance limitations compared to native UI development. Additionally, the availability of certain platform-specific features and UI components may be limited in React Native.

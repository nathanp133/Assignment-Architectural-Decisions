# Native, Web, or Hybrid App

## Decision: Develop a native mobile app.

## Justification:

    React Native allows for code reusability across multiple platforms (iOS and Android), reducing development time and effort.
    Hybrid apps provide a balance between native-like user experience and cross-platform compatibility.
    The retail company's requirement for offline mode, push notifications, and integration with payment gateways can be effectively achieved with React Native and its extensive ecosystem.

## Alternatives Considered:

    Native App: Developing separate native apps for iOS and Android would provide full control and customization, but it would require more development effort and resources.
    Web App: Developing a web app would provide cross-platform compatibility, but it may not have the same level of performance and native-like user experience as a hybrid app.

## Consequences:
Developing a hybrid app using React Native may have some limitations compared to native app development. It may require additional effort to fine-tune performance and ensure compatibility across different devices and operating system versions. Some platform-specific features may have limited support in React Native, requiring custom native modules or additional workarounds.

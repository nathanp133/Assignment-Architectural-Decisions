# Permissions

## Decision: 
Implement a permission system based on user roles and access control lists (ACLs).

## Justification:

    A permission system based on user roles and ACLs allows for granular control over access to app features and data.
    It provides flexibility to define different levels of access permissions for various user types (e.g., customers, administrators, support staff).
    It enables the retail company to enforce data security and privacy by restricting access to sensitive information.

## Alternatives Considered:

    No Permission System: Not implementing a permission system would pose security risks and make it difficult to manage access to app features and data.
    Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): RBAC is another common approach for managing permissions, but it may be less flexible than a combination of user roles and ACLs.

## Consequences:
Implementing a permission system based on user roles and ACLs may require additional development effort and complexity compared to simpler approaches. It may also require careful planning and ongoing maintenance to ensure the system remains secure and efficient.

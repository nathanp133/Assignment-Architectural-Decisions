# Backend Language

## Decision: 
Use Node.js as the backend language.

## Justification:

    Node.js is known for its scalability and ability to handle concurrent connections, which is essential for handling a large number of customer requests in a retail app.
    Node.js has a rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks that can accelerate backend development.
    Using the same language (JavaScript) for both frontend (React Native) and backend (Node.js) can promote code reuse and improve development efficiency.

## Alternatives Considered:

    Java: Java is a popular choice for backend development, but it may require more development effort and have a steeper learning curve compared to Node.js.
    Python: Python is known for its simplicity and readability, but it may not have the same level of performance as Node.js for handling concurrent connections.

## Consequences:
Using Node.js as the backend language may require developers to be proficient in JavaScript. Additionally, the availability of certain libraries and frameworks may be more limited compared to other languages like Java or Python.

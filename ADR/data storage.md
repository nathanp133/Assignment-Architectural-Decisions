# Data Storage

## Decision: 

Use a combination of local device storage (e.g., SQLite) and cloud-based storage (e.g., Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage).

## Justification:

    Local device storage (e.g., SQLite) can provide offline storage capabilities, allowing customers to access their order history and other data even without an internet connection.
    Cloud-based storage (e.g., Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage) ensures data synchronization and availability across devices and provides scalability for handling a large amount of data.
    Using a combination of local and cloud storage allows for optimizing storage usage and minimizing network bandwidth requirements.

# Alternatives Considered:

    Onlyusing local device storage: Using only local device storage may limit data accessibility to a specific device and make it challenging to synchronize data across multiple devices.
    Only using cloud-based storage: Relying solely on cloud-based storage may introduce dependency on internet connectivity and may not provide offline data access.

# Consequences:
Using a combination of local device storage and cloud-based storage may require additional development effort to handle data synchronization and manage data storage across different platforms (iOS and Android). It also introduces dependencies on external storage services, requiring proper configuration and security measures.
